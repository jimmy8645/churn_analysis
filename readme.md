## Dataset Overview

- RowNumber: corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.
- CustomerId: contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.
- Surname: the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
- CreditScore: can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
- Geography: a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
- Gender: it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
- Age: this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
- Tenure: refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
        - Balance: also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
        - NumOfProducts: refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
        - HasCrCard: denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.
        - IsActiveMember: active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
        - EstimatedSalary: as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
        - Exited: whether or not the customer left the bank.
